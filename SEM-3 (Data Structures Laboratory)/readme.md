# DATA STRUCTURES LABORATORY (17CSL38)

#### 1. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following Array Operations
1. Creating an Array of N Integer Elements
2. Display of Array Elements with Suitable Headings
3. Inserting an Element (ELEM) at a given valid Position (POS)
4. Deleting an Element at a given valid Position(POS)
5. Exit.

Support the program with functions for each of the above operations

***
#### 2. Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following operationson Strings
1. Read a main String (STR), a Pattern String (PAT) and a Replace String (REP)
2. Perform Pattern Matching Operation: Find and Replace all occurrences of PAT in
STR with REP if PAT exists in STR. Report suitable messages in case PAT does
not exist in STR

Support the program with functions for each of the above operations. Don't use
Built-in functions.
***
#### 3. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on STACK of Integers (Array Implementation of Stack with maximum size MAX)
1. Push an Element on to Stack
2. Pop an Element from Stack
3. Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome
4. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack
5. Display the status of Stack
6. Exit

Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations
***
#### 4. Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for converting an Infix Expression to Postfix Expression.
###### Program should support for both parenthesized and free parenthesized expressions with the operators:
* \+
* \-
* \*
* /
* % (Remainder )
* ^ (Power)
* and alphanumeric operands.
***
#### 5. Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following Stack Applications
1. Evaluation of Suffix expression with single digit operands and operators:
    * \+
    *  -
    * \*
    * /
    *  %
    *  ^

2. Solving Tower of Hanoi problem with n disks
***
#### 6. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Circular QUEUE of Characters (Array Implementation of Queue with maximum size MAX)
1. Insert an Element on to Circular QUEUE
2. Delete an Element from Circular QUEUE
3. Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Circular QUEUE
4. Display the status of Circular QUEUE
5. Exit

Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations
***
#### 7. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Singly Linked List (SLL) of Student Data with the fields: USN, Name, Branch, Sem, PhNo.
1. Create a SLL of N Students Data by using front insertion.
2. Display the status of SLL and count the number of nodes in it
3. Perform Insertion / Deletion at End of SLL
4. Perform Insertion / Deletion at Front of SLL(Demonstration of stack)
5. Exit
***

#### 8. Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the following operations on Doubly Linked List (DLL) of Employee Data with the fields: SSN, Name, Dept, Designation, Sal, PhNo
1. Create a DLL of N Employees Data by using end insertion.
2. Display the status of DLL and count the number of nodes in it
3. Perform Insertion and Deletion at End of DLL
4. Perform Insertion and Deletion at Front of DLL
5. Demonstrate how this DLL can be used as Double Ended Queue
6. Exit

***
#### 9. Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following operationson Singly Circular Linked List (SCLL) with header nodes
