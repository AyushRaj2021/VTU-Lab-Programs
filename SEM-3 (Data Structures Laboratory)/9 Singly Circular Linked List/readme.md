#### Design, Develop and Implement a Program in C for the following operationson Singly Circular Linked List (SCLL) with header nodes
1. Represent and Evaluate a Polynomial P(x,y,z) = 6x^2y^2z - 4yz^5 + 3x^3yz + 2xy^5z - 2xyz^3
2. Find the sum of two polynomials POLY1(x,y,z) and POLY2(x,y,z) and store the
result in POLYSUM(x,y,z)

Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the above operations
